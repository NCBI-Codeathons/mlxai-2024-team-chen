## Project Goals
Use machine learning modules to detect high-order interaction among genomic, omic features that associated with the phenotype. 

## Approach
We use an example dataset with clinical phenotypes and rna expression data for indivudals. We apply machine learning modules to find the important features. Then, for downstream data exploration, we map the features using gene annotation in NCBI databases and create network representations for the interactions. 

## Results
The performance of feature selections / prediction module will be evaluable based on ROC curves. The purpose of presenting the network of interactions is more for data visualization.
